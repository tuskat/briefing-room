BunnyLord Meeting Room speech :

- One presentator : 
    mouth moving animation sync to the word by word application (just update at the same time)
    words timeout randomly chose? or depending on lenght?
    one animation to switch the diapositive on the diaporama
    
- Diaporama :
    Each time we end up a whole textblock, we change randomly picked diapositives
    diapositive must be accorded to the randomly chose text, else it's not funny
    
- Element of Surprise (Later) :
    The element of surprise is just a randomly placed npc that do nothing particular,
    and that the presentator might mention during his speech. preferably at the beginning.
    
- Speech :
    The most important and awesome part. The words that come off the mouth of the presentator
    are made to sell me, Cedric Marcellin, to whoever is checking this dumbass website.
    Blocks of text are randomly selecting in separates piles that are accorded one to another.
    Else the text wouldn't make any sense at all. so everytime we f5, the speech will be slightly
    to awesomely different.
    
- Data :
    The data in this project shoudl be stocked, in an easily manageable database. I recommend picking MySql
    but maybe something awesomer exist...who know. The purpose is to easily manage them so we don't have to implement
    more code to add speech patterns, it allows us to update it whenever, and it is way better to have Sql database
    if we want, a lot, like a lot, very very much a lot of, awesome variations.
